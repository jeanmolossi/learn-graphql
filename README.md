**Install dependencies**

`yarn install`

**Setup the API**

`yarn typeorm migration:run`

**Setup the Redis Cache Container**

`yarn docker:install`

# :runner: Getting Started

Run the following command **on project root folder** in order to start the application in a development environment:

```
  // Run server API
  yarn start
```

If you have issues with container try:

`yarn docker:up`

### :man_teacher: Explaining folders

- `@types/` have the index definition file. Add the user in request of Express
- `shared/` are the folders with the content that will be shared in all application
  - Inside that we have `infra/http/`. That are the http layer of the application
  - We have too `infra/graphql/`. That are the graphql layer, all the contents depends of the graphql should be inside that layer
    - `graphql/`. That are the graphql layer, all the contents of a specific module depends of the graphql should be inside that folder
    - Inside `graphql/`
      - `entities/` GraphQL entities from specific module - **That creates the interface to Typeorm**;
      - `inputs/` GraphQL inputs to do the query;
      - `resolvers/` GraphQL resolvers;
  - Inside `infra/typeorm/` are the repositories and the entities:
    - `entities/` Typeorm entities from specific module - **Thats should implements GraphQL entity**;
    - `repositories/` Typeorm repositories. That should be implements the models are inside the `/infra/repositories/`
- `modules/` are the folders/layers from a specific module of the application.
  - Inside that we have the specific module like `users/` that have:
    - `infra/` which contains:
      - `repositories/`. That contains de model of the repositories should be implements
