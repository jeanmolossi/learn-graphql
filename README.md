### :man_teacher: Explaining folders

- `shared/` are the folders with the content that will be shared in all application
  - Inside that we have `infra/http/`. That are the http layer of the application
  - We have too `infra/graphql/`. That are the graphql layer, all the contents depends of the graphql should be inside that layer
- `modules/` are the folders/layers from a specific module of the application.
  - Inside that we have the specific module like `users/` that have:
    - `infra/` which contains:
      - `graphql/`. That are the graphql layer, all the contents of a specific module depends of the graphql should be inside that folder
      - `repositories/`. That contains de model of the repositories should be implements
    - Inside `graphql/`
      - `entities/` GraphQL entities from specific module;
      - `inputs/` GraphQL inputs to do the query;
      - `resolvers/` GraphQL resolvers;
    - Inside `typeorm/`
      - `repositories/` Typeorm repositories. That should be implements the models are inside the `/infra/repositories/`
